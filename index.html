It would bring me a great relief knowing that having good results from a police check could show others that I’m safe, hense being able to work openly and freely in a team enviroment.</p>

                      The purpose of the test was to determine if you are a person who is deemed to have safe behaviours, from the results of passing this test, i can clearly see that my personal background has proven to show that there are no underlining issues criminally to be working with others, due to this result others can feel safe when we are required to work together in a team environment, though a police check doesn’t mean a great deal, it’s good to know who you are socializing with in a team.

          <hr class="lines">
          <p class="section-subtitle">Frustrated with your China Internet? With the crackdown of VPNs in China, it is increasingly becoming hard to get access to internet beyond the great firewall of China, like Google, Facebook etc, so the use of encrypted internet traffic flowing through proxy servers is slowly emerging as a way to bypass such protocols in this place, so I would like to create a portable device that has a proxy server already installed where you can easily carry it with you and create a Wi-Fi hot spot for on the go, or you can connect power to its end keep it as a permanent setting in an office or home. <br>  <br>  <br>I am the sort of person that travels a lot and I always like to be connected to the Internet, my travels in China can somewhat be awkward when the VPN servers don’t work, whilst you remain in the country you have to deal with jumping over the great firewall of China. Recently I found this proxy server program called Shadowsocks, the program acts as a gateway between you and the internet to bypass local ISP’s (Internet service providers) who in turn block all traffic heading out to the websites mentioned earlier, integrating this software onto a device such as a Raspberry  is a cheap and easily assembled solution to this problem., I believe that this sort of project will help me and others to  develop the skillset needed in the future to secure an ideal job with the practice of JavaScript and programing. <br> <br>I believe that any foreigner travelling to China would have a great advantage to have one of these devices in their possession, whether it would be for use at work or at home. Relating back to my first experience in China, because I didn’t have a working VPN, it was a very daunting memory being stuck in a foreign country without internet. I literary arrived at the Airport, found out that may cellular roaming wasn’t working, therefore, my Google translator wasn’t Working, as well Google maps and Google search engine, at that time it was like I was lost in the wilderness.
From theses fond memories I would like to see a device capable of being a Proxy and a Wi-Fi router in one, as well as being able to be compact and portable to carry around in your handbag or man purse. <br> <br>

          <p class="section-subtitle">To get the project up and running, we would need to put together a team of a programmer and a confident computer engineer, in the begining we would need to run innovative hardware such as the Raspberry PI that will easily integrate the use of the already existing Shadowsocks proxy server service, the programmer would need to code the software onto the device to a point where it has a user friendly interface and the computer engineer would design and assemble the Raspbery PI into a suitable casing to make it visually appealing, I think it’s very important for this device to be compact and durable for the end the user to be able to just throw it in the backpack or just in back pocket for when they are on the move, the device would need a source of power, such as a power bank as well as a power cable for a more permanent setting in a home or office. It is important for the users of the product to have a great user friendly and easy to use interface, as the intention of this device would be a plug and play operation without the need for technical coding or setup, thus there is a chance that the programmer used in setting up the project would face some challenges in making sure there were no bugs in the coding.
As this project will be a proxy Wi-Fi router, there may be the demand for commercial use, foreign companies that are relying on traditional VPNs to access foreign website data are usually stuck with bottle neck speeds with a user overload, however with the ShadowSocks server there is the choice to set up your own dedicated proxy servers on the system, this in which can be tailor made to be input into this device as a standard feature.

                <p class="wow zoomIn" data-wow-duration="1000ms" data-wow-delay="100ms"> There are three components of this project, first of all the Raspberry PI will be the brains of the project, similar to a desktop computer it will run the necessary code it takes to run the software, secondly the device will need to be run by some sort of Power Supply, it can either be run on a power cable or power bank, that really depends on the application.  Finally the open source software Shadowsocks is the most relevant part of the project, this program acts as a gateway between you and the internet to bypass local ISP’s. <br><br>  There is various skill sets needed to set up this device, though most of the coding is from open source software, a programmer would have to initially implement the code for the Shadow socks proxy on to the Raspberry PI using programs such as JavaScript or Python. The assembly of the hardware and design of the product would have to be done an electrical engineer in order to assemble the components in a compact and durable state.  Nowadays the sourcing of all the hardware required can be found of sites such as Amazon and local computer hardware stores.    <br> <br></p>

          <hr class="lines">
          <p class="section-subtitle">Upon successful completion of this project, anybody in the possession of this product who is travelling to or already in China will be able to access the Internet freely inconvenience at the switch of a button, people using this product will be able to access international websites more freely. There is a  possible chance to use this device in a commercial environment, If companies were able to set up its Proxy Wi-Fi device In their office they would be able to access their offshore company’s servers at greater speeds offered by typical VPNs, thus creating a more efficient work environment.
There will be significant challenges and learning curves from this project, but there will be a great rewards nearing the end of the completed project.

    <hr class="lines">
    <p class="section-subtitle">Though I couldn't possibly know in advance whether the job you're applying for is likely to be my ideal job or not,i found a few elements that jumped out at me, a position like this would suite someone who is highly motivated in creating exceptional front end graphical user interface experiences for users based in China, this position is looking for team members that have a passion in setting the bar for what vehicle mobile user experience, by using the skills of software engineering, the position requires excellent interpersonal communication and a shared passion for making the world a better place, not only with the end user but with the team and back end developers. I find that creating projects related to the end user having a great experience is somewhat down my alley, the feeling of creation and the reactions of end user is very rewarding.</p>
